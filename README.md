## `Hello there!` :wave:

I'm happy to share some of the cool projects that I have been working on at Trend Micro.


### `Code` :octocat:

The repositories (both public and private) are a collection of work that I've worked on/collaborated for Trend Micro and can be used/fixed/improved/shared with the same good intentions it was written.


### `Work` :nerd_face:

I'm a DevOps & Cloud Solution Architect with my speciality in product design, development and infrastructure. Currently, I am working as a Technical Sales Engineer for Trend Micro.


### `Contribute` :clap:

If you encounter a bug or think of a useful feature, or find something confusing in the docs, please
**create a new issue**

> **P.S.: Make sure to use an Issue Template available in the repository**

I :hearts:  pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug or contribute to a feature or simply correct a typo, please feel free to do so.

If you're thinking of adding a new feature, consider opening an issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns with the direction of the project (and potentially
save yourself some time!).


### `Social` :cocktail:

I'm available on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/georgedavisc), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GDCrocx) and via [email](mailto:george{underscore}davis{@}trendmicro{dot}com), if you are interested in a quick chat.
